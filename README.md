# Human Activity Recognition Project
## Project Process:

- Recorded acceleration signals (Using the Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite on iPhone) for two different activities (Football and Swimming)
- Loaded the recorded signals into a Jupyter notebook
- Visualised the recorded signals
- Preprocessed the recorded signal
- Characterised the recorded signals using systematic time-series feature engineering
- Developed a machine learning algorithm for Human Activity Recognition (Random Forest Classifier, 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validation)
- Analysed the performance of the algorithm.
